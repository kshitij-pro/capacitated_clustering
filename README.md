## Capacitated clustering problem
In a capacitated clustering problem (CCP) set of n items having some weights/demands are grouped/clustered into k clusters which are all disjoint such that the total weight of a cluster does not cross the maximum capacity. Here we assume that all the individual weights/demands are less than the max. capacity and capacity for all clusters is same.

Elample of a CCP is a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with one depot and multiple vehicles of same capacity. There are n cities each with some demand and the problem is to travel in such a way that their demand is satisfied and we get to travel only the minimum distance.
